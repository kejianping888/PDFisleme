# AcroExch.PDDoc
# The underlying PDF representation of a document. This is a creatable interface. There is a correspondence between
# a PDDoc object and an ASFile object (an opaque representation of an open file made available through an interface
# encapsulating Acrobat’s access to file services), and the PDDoc object is the hidden object behind every AVDoc object.
#  An ASFile object may have zero or more underlying files, so a PDF file does not always correspond to a single disk
# file. For example, an ASFile object may provide access to PDF data in a database.
#
# Through PDDoc objects, your application can perform most of the Document menu items from Acrobat (delete pages,
# replace pages, and so on), create and delete thumbnails, and set and retrieve document information fields.
#
# Methods
# The PDDoc object has the following methods.

    #
    # Parameters
    # nType
    #
    # Specifies the way in which the file should be saved.
    #
    # nType is a logical OR of one or more of the following flags:
    #
    # 0 = PDSaveIncremental — Write changes only, not the complete file. This will always result in a larger file,
    # even if objects have been deleted.

    # 1 = PDSaveFull — Write the entire file to the filename specified by szFullPath.
    #
    # 2 = PDSaveCopy — Write a copy of the file into the file specified by szFullPath, but keep using the old file.
    # This flag can only be specified if PDSaveFull is also used.
    #
    # 3 = PDSaveCollectGarbage — Remove unreferenced objects; this often reduces the file size, and its usage is
    # encouraged. This flag can only be specified if PDSaveFull is also used.
    #
    # 4 = PDSaveLinearized — Save the file optimized for the web, providing hint tables. This allows the PDF file to be
    # byte-served. This flag can only be specified if PDSaveFull is also used.
    #
    # Note:If you save a file optimized for the web using the PDSaveLinearized flag, you must follow this sequence:
    #
    # 1.  Open the PDF file with PDDoc.Open.
    #
    # 2.  Call PDDoc.Save using the PDSaveLinearized flag.
    #
    # 3.  Call PDDoc.Close.
    #
    # This allows batch optimization of files.
